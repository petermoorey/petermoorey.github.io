I'm excited to announce the availability of <a href="https://apimocha.com" target="_blank">API Mocha</a>, a free online web service for mocking Application Programmable Interface (API) responses.

API Mocha is enables software developers and system integrators to:
- Simulate APIs for the purpose of software development/testing
- Create customizable responses to API calls including data, headers, status codes and delay
- Easily inspect data sent by web hooks
- Quickly test changes to the behaviour/response/design of an API
- Avoiding delay whilst waiting for an API to be developed by another team

Please visit the website at <a href="https://apimocha.com" target="_blank">https://apimocha.com</a> and try it out!

# How it works 

It's really simple and fast, here's what to do:

1. Go to the API Mocha <a href="https://apimocha.com">home page</a> and create an endpoint with a name such as 'my cool project'
2. After you create an endpoint you'll be redirected to a page where you can view API requests
3. Send an API request to the endpoint and you'll see it magically appear on the page
4. Click the Edit button and define how you'd like API Mocha to respond to future requests with the same HTTP method and URL
5. Make another API request and you'll see the mocked response. Awesome right!
